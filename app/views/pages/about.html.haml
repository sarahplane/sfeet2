        About Sfeet
      %h5
        Sfeet, short for “Smaller Feet”, is a variation of ‘Reduced Footprint’.

      The concept of sfeet is to provide a place for consumers to enhance their
      decision making process to reduce their impact on the environment, protect their bodies,
      and ensure their purchases are not negatively impacting others
      (people and animals alike). Sfeet accomplishes this by providing a location for
      users to share their information about a product’s sustainability standards,
      the quality of the product, and other key features regarding the product, to help
      inform other users about a product prior to purchasing that product.
